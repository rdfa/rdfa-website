RDFa is an extension to HTML5 that helps you markup things like People, Places, 
Events, Recipes and Reviews. Search Engines and Web Services use this markup
to generate better search listings and give you better visibility on the Web,
so that people can find your website more easily.

          <h2>Linked Data</h2>
           <p>
Linked Data is a relatively new way of thinking about how we publish data. At
present, there is a great deal of data on the Web, but it is either locked down
in a private database, or published in a way that is not very useful to 
computers. The data we have today is disconnected and lives in data silos. 
These data silos are not linked to one another, which goes against the core
design of the Web. It is important that we fix both the data silo-ing 
and data linking problem. If we do so, computers will be able to
use the data more easily and thus make our lives better as a result.
             <strong>
RDFa is a way of publishing Linked Data in HTML5 documents &mdash; it solves 
both the data silo-ing and data linking problem.

          <h2>Immediate Benefits</h2>
          <p>
There are immediate benefits for integrating RDFa into your website today.
By using RDFa to express 
<a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99170&topic=1088472&ctx=topic">Google Rich Snippets</a> or 
<a href="http://linter.structured-data.org/examples/">schema.org</a>, 
your web pages will be displayed in an enhanced format on all major search 
engines. You can also use Facebook's 
<a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph Protocol</a>, 
which is based on RDFa, to express concepts that are contained in your web 
pages, like people, places, events, movies and recipes.
            <strong>
The search and social companies are serious about indexing RDFa content, 
which means that you may want to get serious about adding it into your pages
before your competitors do.

          <h2>Using RDFa in HTML5</h2>
           <p>
RDFa not only works in HTML5, but is a general technology for Linked Data 
markup in a variety of HTML-like languages. This means that it works well in 
XML documents, SVG documents, as well as HTML4, XHTML1 and XHTML5 documents. 
In fact, if your markup language is based on XML, then you can already use 
RDFa in your documents today. There is a version of RDFa for beginners called
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/">RDFa Lite</a>. 
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/">full version of RDFa</a> is 
more expressive and allows Web authors to solve just about any structured data 
markup problem that they might throw at it. 
             <strong>
Whatever popular Web document format you use, chances are that RDFa already works in it.
